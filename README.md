## Dear VP People Developer / Recruiter,

this recruitment task was built with the _Facebook's_ powerful `create-react-app` boilerplate.

### **Running the project in the Developer Mode**

To run this project in the Developer Mode, please follow these steps:

- clone or download and extract the repository
- open the main folder (_landing-page_) and open the terminal within it
- enter the command `npm install && npm start`
  - I assume you have the npm package manager installed. If not, please visit this page for the installation manual: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
- after a dozen of seconds, your default browser should be opened and you will see the working project

### **Running the live version**

You can also view the [live website](https://staszek998.github.io/vp-people/) running on the _GitHub Pages_.
